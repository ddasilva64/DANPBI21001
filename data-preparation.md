# Data preparation



### What's ETL?

* **Extract**: From virtually any data source, from flat to complex files, databases, or cloud services
* **Transform**: This allows us to modify or enrich the extracted information without modifying the source
* **Load**: Once the transformation is done, it's responsible for loading the result to the data model
