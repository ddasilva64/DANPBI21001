# Data preparation



### What's ETL?

* **Extract**: From virtually any data source, from flat to complex files, databases, or cloud services
* **Transform**: This allows us to modify or enrich the extracted information without modifying the source
* **Load**: Once the transformation is done, it's responsible for loading the result to the data model

### Transform data with Power Query

**Power Query**

It's a data connection technology that enables us to discover, connect, combine, and refine disparate data sources to meet our analytics needs

**What does Power Query do?**

* **Extract**: From virtually any data source
* **Transform**: From merging, combining, cleaning, or enriching the data
* **Upload**: The data for further analysis in Power BI

**Points to consider**

* The purpose of Power Query is to obtain data from a variety of sources and prepare it for further analysis
* The purpose of this tool isn't to analyze the data
* Magic: Collection of steps performed to reach a result, it also allows going back or forward without modifying the data source. Similar to the process that a macro performs in Excel
