# Data visualization

### Data Storytelling

* It allows us to make users develop in a more dynamic way with our reports
* It helps us capture the user's attention and he himself discovers new information through interactions

### Create visualizations

Choosing the correct visualization is one of the most important parts of our project: Communicating our ideas or discoveries to a larger audience in a dynamic way

* Less is more
* Colors are important, use them well
* Keep your elements well aligned
* Be consistent
* Isn't always good to show a whole figure
* Show only related information
* A bad choice of a visual can cause the information to not be transmitted correctly

* **Advanced tooltips**: Allows to show additional detail to our visualizations
