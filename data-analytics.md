### Data analytics with Python/R

Power BI offers the possibility of integrating BI tools, with languages such as Python or R To make an example script in R, download and install R and R Studio

The URLs are available in the Recommended reading or tools section

![We get the data of the example from a CSV file](https://i.imgur.com/3SvvvNo.png)

![We load the desired file](https://i.imgur.com/uKPzu5t.png)

![We're going to specify data and create a table (warehouse) of measures](https://i.imgur.com/6aO2Vbh.png)

![We create a measure](https://i.imgur.com/jwkDF6t.png)

To check the measurement we create a table and see that it works OK

Now we will take these two variables to a graph made with R
