### What is Power BI Service?

### Share our reports

**Workspaces in Power BI Service**

They're the places to collaborate with colleagues, peers to create collections of dashboards, reports, and paginated reports

The work area defines the set of users who have access to specific data, reports, and dashboards. Additionally, it is possible:

* Assign specific roles
* Separate areas of the organization
* Creation of applications and template applications

### Create a dashboard in Power BI

### Deploy a gateway with Power BI Service

It's a component that facilitates network data access (access controller), which allows users to be granted their connection as long as they meet certain criteria

**Gateway Types**

* **Personal mode**: allows a single user to connect to sources without them being able to be shared
* **Multiple Mode**: Allows multiple users to connect to multiple local data sources
